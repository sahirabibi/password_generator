# password_generator
A GUI created from tkinter to save url, username, and password for user. Generates random password if one not provided. 
All data is saved to a text file named "safe_pass.txt".
Included are two theme options: dark and light. 
Current default is dark theme. 
Theme will need to be updated manually using stored variables found at the top of the file.
# ---- UPDATE THEME ---- #
DARK stores link to image using darker colors 
LIGHT stores link to image using lighter colors 
DARK_BG and LIGHT_BG are colors that can use user to change the background of the window in order to line it up with the chosen theme.
